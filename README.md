**ABSTRACT:**
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impacts motor function, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management. This report presents a detailed analysis of Parkinson's disease classification using a dataset consisting of various clinical and physiological features. The dataset includes attributes such as motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity), speech features (e.g., voice frequency, amplitude), and demographic information (e.g., age, gender). The target variable for classification is the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease, categorized as binary outcomes.
We employ several machine learning techniques to develop predictive models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines etc. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrate that advanced classification methods can achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. This analysis not only highlights the importance of specific features in the classification process but also offers insights into optimizing diagnostic strategies for early detection of Parkinson's disease.


**Introduction**
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by a gradual decline in motor function and quality of life. Affecting millions worldwide, PD presents a significant challenge to healthcare systems due to its complex symptomatology and the need for early intervention to manage disease progression effectively. Early diagnosis is crucial for implementing timely treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.
Advances in data science and machine learning offer promising avenues for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and early detection of Parkinson's disease. By analysing datasets that include various clinical, physiological, and demographic features, researchers can develop predictive models to differentiate between patients with Parkinson's disease and those without.
This report focuses on the classification of Parkinson's disease using a comprehensive dataset that includes features such as motor symptoms, speech characteristics, and demographic variables. The objective is to explore and evaluate different machine learning techniques to build robust classification models. Through this analysis, we aim to identify the most significant features contributing to the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and to assess the performance of various predictive algorithms.
The following sections will detail the methodology employed, the results obtained from different classification models, and the implications for improving diagnostic practices in Parkinson's disease.
